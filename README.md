# Mixed data and TimeAndDate data

Mixed data-
numerical and categorical data mixed in a feature
like cabin in titanic have values b5 c16 d41...etc, if we assume it as one category then a
lot of categories will be there
b,c,d... is cat. and other part is numerical so we split the column into two and store first
part as cat. and other as numerical data

or can have data like in one col- d,c,r,1,4,7,a,b so here we create two cols one having
categorical and other num. data and for a num. data corresponding cat. data will be NA
and vice versa
